# Algorithms

This repository contains many basic algorithms coded in C/C++.

Many more algorithms will be updated here.

#### Note
    1. In some IDE of C/C++, it will not detect few libraries like "algorithm.h" and "bits/stdc++.h". In that case, 
       change the extension of the files from .c to .cpp
    
    2. Also, in linux, to run C/C++ files with "math.h", add -lm while executing. Eg. g++/gcc <filename>.c -lm
    
    3. In Graph problems, in weight adjacency matrices, 0 in input represents 0 distance from i->i (from same vertex to same vertex)  and 0          represents INF when is not equal to j , i.e, from one vertex to different vertex if there is no path between them.
